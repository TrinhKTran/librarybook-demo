# librarybook-demo
Before designing, here are a few key questions to clarify:

Users and Roles

Are we dealing with just Librarians and Patrons, or do we also have Admins?

Should librarians act as admins (e.g., managing books, resetting accounts, resolving late fees)?

Environment

Should this system run on the public internet, or is it meant for internal use in the library only?

Do you want cloud deployment (AWS/GCP) or local/on-prem?

HIPAA Security

Are we collecting any health information, or is HIPAA a placeholder for general data protection (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?

Is encryption at rest and in transit required?

Offline Access

Should the library system work when internet is down (sync later), or is this cloud-first?

Front-end Preference

Between React and Angular, do you have a preference or are we free to choose based on your comfort?

Once I get your answers, I’ll then lay out:

🌐 UX Layer
Core components like Login, SearchBook, CheckInOutPanel, LateFeeViewer.

🔗 Middle Layer (REST APIs)
/api/books/available

/api/checkout

/api/checkin

/api/fees

/api/users

🔐 Security Layer
JWT Authentication & Role-Based Access

Protocols: HTTPS + TLS + Token expiration + refresh

Possibly OAuth2 with identity providers

🧠 Domain + JPA Layer
Entities:

User, Book, CheckoutRecord, Fee, AdminAuditLog

Relationships:

One-to-many: User → CheckoutRecords

Late fees → Computed from due date
